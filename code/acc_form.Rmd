<!--HOW TO COMPLETE THIS FORM:-->

<!--
1. Checkboxes in this document appear as follows: 

- [ ] This is a checkbox 

To check a checkbox, replace [ ] by [x], as follows: 

- [x] This is a checked checkbox 

Note that older versions of RStudio (versions lower than 1.3) may not create a formatted checkbox but will leave the original characters, i.e., literally "[ ]" or "[x]". It's fine to submit a PDF in this form.
 
2. For text answers, simply type the relevant text in the areas indicated. A blank line starts a new paragraph. 
 
3. Comments (like these instructions) provide additional instructions throughout the form. There is no need to remove them; they will not appear in the compiled document. 

4. If you are comfortable with Markdown syntax, you may choose to include any Markdown-compliant formatting in the form. For example, you may wish to include R code chunks and compile this document in R Markdown.
-->

This form documents the artifacts associated with the article (i.e., the data and code supporting the computational findings) and describes how to reproduce the findings.


# Part 1: Data

- [ ] This paper does not involve analysis of external data (i.e., no data are used or the only data are generated by the authors via simulation in their code).

<!--
If box above is checked and if no simulated/synthetic data files are provided by the authors, please skip directly to the Code section. Otherwise, continue.
-->

- [x] I certify that the author(s) of the manuscript have legitimate access to and permission to use the data used in this manuscript.

<!-- If data are simulated using random number generation, please be sure to set the random number seed in the code you provide -->

## Abstract

<!--
Provide a short (< 100 words), high-level description of the data
-->
We analyze two datasets: **CD4 Data** from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study, containing 2,376 CD4+ cell count measurements from 369 HIV-infected men over 8.5 years, with 1–12 measurements per individual, resulting in a highly unbalanced dataset.
**Serum Cholesterol Data** from the National Cooperative Gallstone Study includes patients with floating gallstones in high-dose and placebo groups, with cholesterol measured at baseline and follow-ups. Many measurements are missing due to missed visits, inadequate lab specimens, or early termination.





## Availability


- [x] Data **are** publicly available.
- [ ] Data **cannot be made** publicly available.

- [ ] Data are or will be made available through some other mechanism, described here:


<!-- If data are available by request to the authors or some other data owner, please make sure to explain the process of requesting access to the data. -->

### Non-publicly available data

<!--
The Journal of the American Statistical Association requires authors to make data accompanying their papers available to the scientific community except in cases where: 1) public sharing of data would be impossible, 2) suitable synthetic data are provided which allow the main analyses to be replicated (recognizing that results may differ from the "real" data analyses), and 3) the scientific value of the results and methods outweigh the lack of reproducibility.

Please discuss the lack of publicly available data. For example:
-	why data sharing is not possible,
-	what synthetic data are provided, and 
-	why the value of the paper's scientific contribution outweighs the lack of reproducibility.

# Part 2: Code

## Abstract

<!--
Provide a short (< 100 words), high-level description of the code. If necessary, more details can be provided in files that accompany the code. If no code is provided, please state this and say why (e.g., if the paper contains no computational work).
-->
Our code investigates the performance of the HCP method across various aspects, including **marginal coverage** (`HCP_marginal.R`), **conditional coverage** (`HCP_conditional.R`), **local coverage**  (`HCP_local.R`.), and **simultaneous prediction** (`HCP_simul.R`). These codes are located in different folders for tables and figures.
We provide the code for all tables and figures in the paper, each with a corresponding folder containing a `main.R` file that calls all necessary scripts and can be run directly to reproduce the results.

# Part 3: Reproducibility workflow

<!--
The materials provided should provide a straightforward way for reviewers and readers to reproduce analyses with as few steps as possible. 
-->

## Scope

The provided workflow reproduces:

- [ ] Any numbers provided in text in the paper
- [x] The computational method(s) presented in the paper (i.e., code is provided that implements the method(s))
- [x] All tables and figures in the paper
- [ ] Selected tables and figures in the paper, as explained and justified below:

## Workflow

### Location

The workflow is available:

<!--
Check all that apply, and in the case of a Git repository include unique identifier, such as specific commit ID, branch, release, or tag.
-->
- [ ] As part of the paper’s supplementary material.
- [x] In this Git repository: <https://github.com/judywangstat/HCP>
- [ ] Other (please specify):

<!--
Indicate where the materials (generally including the code, unless in a separate location and indicated in the previous section) are available. We strongly encourage authors to place their materials (but not large datasets) in a Git repository hosted on a site such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If the repository is private during the review process, please indicate the location where it will be available publicly upon publication, and also include the materials as a zip file (e.g., obtained directly from the Git hosting site) as supplementary materials.
-->


### Format(s)

<!--
Check all that apply
-->
- [ ] Single master code file 
- [x] Wrapper (shell) script(s)
- [ ] Self-contained R Markdown file, Jupyter notebook, or other literate programming approach
- [ ] Text file (e.g., a readme-style file) that documents workflow
- [ ] Makefile
- [ ] Other (more detail in *Instructions* below)

### Instructions

<!--
Describe how to use the materials provided to reproduce analyses in the manuscript. Additional details can be provided in file(s) accompanying the reproducibility materials. If no workflow is provided, please state this and say why (e.g., if the paper contains no computational work).
-->
Directly access the Git webpage: <https://github.com/judywangstat/HCP>, which contains all the folders corresponding to the tables and figures in the paper. Each table and figure has its own folder, which includes all the necessary scripts and a `main.R` file to call them. 
Download the files and install the required R packages. Our program can **automatically set the paths** in the RStudio environment, so you do not need to manually configure them. However, the original folder structure must remain unchanged.
Once the **paths are correctly set**, you can simply click on `main.R` to run the program directly. For a single master code file implementing the proposed method, simply run `CD4_HCP.R` in Table 3 folder.


### Expected run-time

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard desktop machine:

- [ ] < 1 minute
- [ ] 1-10 minutes
- [x] 10-60 minutes
- [ ] 1-8 hours
- [ ] > 8 hours
- [ ] Not feasible to run on a desktop machine, as described here:

### Additional information (optional)

<!--
OPTIONAL: Additional documentation provided (e.g., R package vignettes, demos or other examples) that show how to use the provided code/software in other settings.
-->

# Notes (optional)

<!--
OPTIONAL: Any other relevant information not covered on this form. If reproducibility materials are not publicly available at the time of submission, please provide information here on how the reviewers can view the materials.
