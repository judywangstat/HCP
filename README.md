# Hierarchical Conformal Prediction for Clustered Data with Missing Responses


## Code
Our code investigates the performance of the HCP method across various aspects, including **marginal coverage** (`HCP_marginal.R`), **conditional coverage** (`HCP_conditional.R`), **local coverage**  (`HCP_local.R`.), and **simultaneous prediction** (`HCP_simul.R`). These codes are located in different folders for tables and figures.
We provide the code for all tables and figures in the paperâ€™s simulation and real data analysis, each with a corresponding folder containing a `main.R` file that calls all necessary scripts and can be run directly to reproduce the results.



## Instructions for Use
First, make sure to install the required R packages by running the following command:
```R
install.packages(c("MASS", "stats", "grf", "quantreg", "doParallel", "doRNG", "lme4", "merTools", "randomForest", "rstudioapi"))
```

To reproduce the program results, simply **download** the entire `simulation` and `real data` folders.
Our program can automatically set the **paths**, so no manual setup is required.
However, to ensure the paths are recognized correctly, please note the following:
1. The code should be executed in the **RStudio** environment.
2. The original **folder structure** must remain unchanged.


If the above two conditions are not met, the file **paths** in each `.R` file must be manually configured, including specifying paths for function calls, loading input data, and saving results.


Once the paths are correctly set, simply click on the `main.R` file in each folder to run the program directly. The results will be automatically saved in the corresponding folder.
