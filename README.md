# Hierarchical Conformal Prediction for Clustered Data with Missing Responses
## Code
Our code investigates the performance of the HCP method across various aspects, including **marginal coverage** (`HCP_marginal.R`), **conditional coverage** (`HCP_conditional.R`), **local coverage**  (`HCP_local.R`.), and **simultaneous prediction** (`HCP_simul.R`). These codes are located in different folders for tables and figures.
We provide the code for all tables and figures in the paper, each with a corresponding folder containing a `main.R` file that calls all necessary scripts and can be run directly to reproduce the results.
