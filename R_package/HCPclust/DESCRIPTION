Description: Implements hierarchical conformal prediction for clustered data with missing responses. The method uses repeated cluster-level
    splitting and within-cluster subsampling to accommodate dependence, and
    inverse-probability weighting to correct distribution shift induced by missingness.
    Conditional densities are estimated by inverting fitted conditional quantiles
    (linear quantile regression or quantile regression forests), and p-values are
    aggregated across resampling and splitting steps using the Cauchy combination test.
